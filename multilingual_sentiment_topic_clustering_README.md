## Multilingual Sentiment and Topic Clustering

This Python code snippet, `multilingual_sentiment_topic_clustering.py`, is designed to perform sentiment analysis and topic clustering on a given set of comments in multiple languages. The code utilizes various natural language processing (NLP) libraries and pre-trained models to process the input comments, identify their languages, and perform sentiment analysis and topic clustering.

### Key Features

- Multilingual support for sentiment analysis and topic clustering
- Utilizes pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Transformers library
- Language identification using Stanza, Spacy, and TextBlob
- Customizable thresholds and parameters for topic clustering

### Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- numpy
- torch
- transformers
- nltk
- spacy
- spacy_langdetect
- stanza
- pycountry
- textblob
- scikit-learn

### Usage

1. Set the appropriate paths and parameters in the code snippet, such as `sentiment_model_path`, `base_cluster_path`, and `stop_words_path`.
2. Replace the `input_comment` list with the comments you want to analyze.
3. Run the `multilingual_sentiment_topic_clustering.py` script.

### Output

The script processes the input comments and generates a DataFrame containing the following information:

- Sentiment analysis results
- Language identification
- Topic clustering results
- Cluster centroids and distances

### Key Functions

- `define_language()`: Identifies the language of a given text using Stanza, Spacy, and TextBlob.
- `MyBert()`: Custom PyTorch model class for topic clustering using the XLM-RoBERTa model.
- `Dataset()`: Custom PyTorch Dataset class for processing input comments.
- `CustomDataset()`: Custom PyTorch Dataset class for processing labeled comments.
- `extract_features_emb()`: Extracts embeddings from pre-trained models for topic clustering.
- `if_bad()`: Filters out comments that do not meet the specified threshold.
- `compare_function()`: Compares the embeddings of comments to the centroids of topic clusters.

### Customization

You can customize the code snippet by adjusting the following parameters:

- `threshold`: The threshold for filtering out comments based on their distance from the cluster centroids.
- `batch_size`: The batch size for processing comments in DataLoader.
- `topic_not_take_li`: A list of topics to exclude from the topic clustering process.
- `weight_li`: A list of weights for combining embeddings from different pre-trained models.

### Note

Please ensure that you have the necessary pre-trained models and files in the specified paths before running the script.
