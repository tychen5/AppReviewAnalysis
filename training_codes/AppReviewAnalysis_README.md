# App Review Analysis

This Python script, `AppReviewAnalysis.py`, is designed to preprocess, analyze, and extract insights from app reviews. It performs various tasks such as data cleaning, sentiment analysis, language detection, and topic modeling using state-of-the-art NLP models and libraries.

### Features

- Load and preprocess app review data from multiple sources
- Remove duplicate reviews and clean comments
- Perform sentiment analysis using the XLM-RoBERTa model
- Detect and handle multiple languages using Spacy, Stanza, and custom language detection functions
- Tokenize and preprocess text using NLTK and custom functions
- Extract features and embeddings using various pre-trained models (XLM-RoBERTa, InfoXLM, XLM-Align)
- Save the processed DataFrame for further analysis

### Libraries and Models

The script utilizes several popular NLP libraries and pre-trained models:

- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Transformers for sentiment analysis and feature extraction
- Spacy and Stanza for language detection and text processing
- NLTK for text tokenization and stemming
- PyCountry for language code conversion
- Torch for deep learning model inference

### Usage

1. Ensure that all required libraries are installed and the necessary files (e.g., stop words, pre-trained models) are available.
2. Replace the file paths in the script with the appropriate paths to your data files and models.
3. Run the script to preprocess and analyze the app review data.
4. The processed DataFrame will be saved as a pickle file for further analysis.

### Customization

The script can be easily customized to suit specific requirements. For example, you can:

- Add your own sentiment analysis function
- Modify the preprocessing functions to handle different data formats or languages
- Use different pre-trained models for feature extraction
- Adjust the weights of the models during inference
- Add additional analysis tasks, such as keyword extraction or topic modeling

### Note

Please ensure that you have the necessary computational resources (e.g., GPU) to run the script, as some of the models used are resource-intensive.
