# Cluster Inferencing Pipeline

This Python code snippet, named `ClusterInferencingPipeline.py`, is designed to perform various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and language detection. The code leverages popular NLP libraries such as NLTK, Spacy, Stanza, and Transformers to process and analyze text data.

### Key Features

1. **Topic Modeling**: The code uses a custom BERT model (`MyBert`) to perform multi-label topic classification. The model is based on the `xlm-roberta-base` architecture and is fine-tuned for the specific task.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**: The code uses the Transformers library to create a sentiment analysis pipeline. It demonstrates how to save and load a pre-trained sentiment analysis model and use it to analyze text data.

3. **Language Detection**: The code uses the Spacy library along with the `spacy_langdetect` package to detect the language of the input text.

4. **Text Preprocessing**: The code includes various text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming using the NLTK library.

5. **Data Handling**: The code demonstrates how to create custom PyTorch datasets and data loaders for efficient data handling and processing.

6. **API Integration**: The code includes an example of sending a request to an API for NLP tasks.

### Dependencies

The code snippet relies on the following libraries:

- functools
- itertools
- json
- math
- operator
- os
- pickle
- random
- re
- requests
- string
- time
- collections
- nltk
- numpy

### Usage

To use the `ClusterInferencingPipeline.py` script, ensure that you have all the required dependencies installed. Replace the dummy paths and values in the `param_dict` with your actual paths and values. Also, replace the paths and model names in the code with your own paths and model names.

After setting up the required paths and values, you can run the script to perform the NLP tasks on your input data. The code demonstrates how to use the custom BERT model for topic modeling, create a sentiment analysis pipeline, and send a request to an API for NLP tasks.
