# Multilabel Text Classification with XLM-RoBERTa

This Python script, `multilabel_text_classification.py`, demonstrates how to perform multilabel text classification using the XLM-RoBERTa model. The code is designed to handle a dataset containing text data with multiple labels per instance. The primary goal is to train a model that can predict the appropriate labels for a given text input.

## Features

- Custom PyTorch model class `MyBert` that extends the `nn.Module` class and utilizes the XLM-RoBERTa model from the `transformers` library.
- Custom PyTorch dataset class `Dataset` that extends the `torch.utils.data.Dataset` class for handling the input data.
- Utilizes the `AutoTokenizer` class from the `transformers` library for tokenizing the input text data.
- DataLoader for efficient data loading and processing.
- Environment variables for controlling GPU usage and parallelism.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 1.8+
- Transformers 4.0+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Replace the `data_path` and `model_path` variables with the appropriate paths to your data and model directories.
2. Load your dataset using the provided `pickle.load()` function, and preprocess it as needed.
3. Create an instance of the `Dataset` class with your preprocessed data and tokenizer.
4. Create a DataLoader instance with the dataset object.
5. Add more tokenizers and dataloaders as needed for your specific use case.
6. Modify the device list (`device_li`) if you want to use multiple GPUs or a different GPU.
7. Add your own logic and functionality to train and evaluate the model.
