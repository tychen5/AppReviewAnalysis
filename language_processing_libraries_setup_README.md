## Language Processing Libraries Setup

This Python script, `language_processing_libraries_setup.py`, automates the process of setting up various Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries and pre-trained models. It downloads and installs the necessary language models and pre-trained models for Spacy, Stanza, NLTK, and Hugging Face Transformers.

### Libraries and Models

The script installs the following libraries and models:

1. **Spacy**: Downloads and installs various Spacy language models for text processing.
2. **Stanza**: Downloads and installs Stanza language models for multilingual NLP.
3. **NLTK**: Downloads and installs popular NLTK data and all NLTK packages.
4. **Hugging Face Transformers**: Loads pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Transformers library, such as XLM-RoBERTa, Twitter XLM-RoBERTa, InfoXLM, and XLM-Align.

### Usage

To use this script, simply run the `language_processing_libraries_setup.py` file. Make sure to update the path to your `parameter.json` file, which should contain the `spacy_libnames_path` key.

```python
with open('path/to/your/parameter.json', 'r') as f:
    param_dict = json.load(f)
spacy_libnames_path = param_dict['spacy_libnames_path']
```

### Dependencies

The script requires the following Python libraries:

- spacy
- pickle
- nltk
- stanza
- gc
- json
- numpy
- pandas
- transformers
- torch

Make sure to install these libraries before running the script.

### Output

After running the script, the following resources will be installed and available for use in your Python environment:

1. Spacy language models
2. Stanza language models
3. NLTK data and packages
4. Pre-trained models from Hugging Face Transformers

These resources can be used for various NLP tasks, such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and more.
